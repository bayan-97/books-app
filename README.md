## Change Log
 
07-09-2020 4:59pm - Create a basic server.js file. Make sure your server is listening for connections on a PORT. Remember to set the view engine and serve your static CSS files.
08-09-2020 4:59pm Create a new view to display the details of a single book. This view should show the title, author, description, ISBN, bookshelf and image of the book. In the file tree provided above, this functionality is included in `views/pages/books/detail.ejs` and `views/pages/books/show.ejs`. The `detail.ejs` file is a partial file that contains just a `<section>` to render the details of a single book. Think of it as a resuable book component. The show.ejs file uses EJS syntax to include this partial.
09-09-2020 4:59pm In your detail view, add a button to reveal a form containing the information of that book. In the provided wireframes, this is shown as a button that says "Update Details" in the file named `13-details.png`.
